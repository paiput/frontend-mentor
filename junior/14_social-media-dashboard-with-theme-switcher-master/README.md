## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()` css functions, even though I only used the second one.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: max(2.222vw, 1.4rem); /* selects the largest value */
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue working on css and semantic html to make my web sites more accessible and better looking.

### Useful resources

- [YouTube video about min(), max() and clamp()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VF-4euyRo) - Kevin Powell's video. He has tons of useful videos about semantic html and especially css.
